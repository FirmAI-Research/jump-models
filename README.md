This repository, named `jumpmodels`, offers a comprehensive implementation of statistical jump models (JMs) for non-parametric regime identification in financial time series. It includes the discrete jump model, continuous statistical jump models, and their sparse variants, designed for efficient feature selection. Each model is encapsulated within a class, adopting a coding style reminiscent of the popular [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) library.

The `jumpmodels/` folder contains all the source code.  An example application focusing on the Nasdaq Composite Price Index series, featuring a simple feature set, is located in the `notebooks/nasdaq_example` directory.

I regret to inform you that complete documentation is not available at the moment. However, the code includes detailed docstrings, and the source code itself serves as the most comprehensive form of documentation for now.
